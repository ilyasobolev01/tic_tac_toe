# GitHub Actions Workflow for Continuous Integration (CI)
#
# Purpose:
# This workflow automatically runs a suite of quality checks on every push
# to the `main` branch and on every pull request targeting `main`.
# Its goal is to ensure that all code merged into the main branch is
# tested, linted, and type-checked.
#
# How it works:
# It uses Nox to manage and run all checks, ensuring that the CI environment
# is identical to the local development environment. The job runs on a matrix
# of Python versions to guarantee compatibility.


# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with multiple versions of Python
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python
